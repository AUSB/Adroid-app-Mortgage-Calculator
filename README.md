# CalculMPr 
This project is to build an Android App which is similar to the mortgage calculator App except for two key differences:

A professional look-and-feel on the outside 

In this app, there are two important characteristics:
1.	To avoid the wrong input by users, I added a toast method which can display an error message (e.g. out of range). We can also determine how long we want to keep the toast visible. 
2.	We also put a speak method which enable a string to be read aloud to the users. 
    In this app,  the whole results will be read after users enter the ANALYZE button.
