# CalculMPr 
This project is to build an Android App which is similar to the mortgage calculator App except for two key differences:

•	A professional look-and-feel on the outside 
•	Full API delegation on the inside

In this app, there are two important characteristics:
1.	To avoid the wrong input by users, we added toast method which can display an error message (e.g. out of range). We can also determine how long we want to keep the toast visible. 
2.	We also put a speak method which enable a string to be read aloud to the users. In this app,  the whole results will be read after users enter the ANALYZE button.
